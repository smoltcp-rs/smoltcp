//! Communication between endpoints.
//!
//! The `socket` module deals with *network endpoints* and *buffering*.
//! It provides interfaces for accessing buffers of data, and protocol state machines
//! for filling and emptying these buffers.
//!
//! The programming interface implemented here differs greatly from the common Berkeley socket
//! interface. Specifically, in the Berkeley interface the buffering is implicit:
//! the operating system decides on the good size for a buffer and manages it.
//! The interface implemented by this module uses explicit buffering: you decide on the good
//! size for a buffer, allocate it, and let the networking stack use it.

/// A network socket.
///
/// This enumeration abstracts the various types of sockets based on the IP protocol.
/// To downcast a `Socket` value down to a concrete socket, use
/// the [AsSocket](trait.AsSocket.html) trait, and call e.g. `socket.as_socket::<UdpSocket<_>>()`.
///
/// The `process` and `dispatch` functions are fundamentally asymmetric and thus differ in
/// their use of the [trait PacketRepr](trait.PacketRepr.html). When `process` is called,
/// the packet length is already known and no allocation is required; on the other hand,
/// `process` would have to downcast a `&PacketRepr` to e.g. an `&UdpRepr` through `Any`,
/// which is rather inelegant. Conversely, when `dispatch` is called, the packet length is
/// not yet known and the packet storage has to be allocated; but the `&PacketRepr` is sufficient
/// since the lower layers treat the packet as an opaque octet sequence.
