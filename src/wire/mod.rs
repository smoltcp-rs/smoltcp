//! Low-level packet access and construction.
//!
//! The `wire` module deals with the packet *representation*. It provides two levels
//! of functionality.
//!
//!  * First, it provides functions to extract fields from sequences of octets,
//!    and to insert fields into sequences of octets. This happens `Packet` family of
//!    structures, e.g. [EthernetFrame] or [Ipv4Packet].
//!  * Second, in cases where the space of valid field values is much smaller than the space
//!    of possible field values, it provides a compact, high-level representation
//!    of packet data that can be parsed from and emitted into a sequence of octets.
//!    This happens through the `Repr` family of structs and enums, e.g. [ArpRepr] or [Ipv4Repr].
// https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38739
//! </ul>
//!
//! [EthernetFrame]: struct.EthernetFrame.html
//! [Ipv4Packet]: struct.Ipv4Packet.html
//! [ArpRepr]: enum.ArpRepr.html
//! [Ipv4Repr]: struct.Ipv4Repr.html
//!
//! The functions in the `wire` module are designed for use together with `-Cpanic=abort`.
//!
//! The `Packet` family of data structures guarantees that, if the `Packet::check_len()` method
//! returned `Ok(())`, then no accessor or setter method will panic; however, the guarantee
//! provided by `Packet::check_len()` may no longer hold after changing certain fields,
//! which are listed in the documentation for the specific packet.
//!
//! The `Packet::new_checked` method is a shorthand for a combination of `Packet::new` and
//! `Packet::check_len`.
//! When parsing untrusted input, it is *necessary* to use `Packet::new_checked()`;
//! so long as the buffer is not modified, no accessor will fail.
//! When emitting output, though, it is *incorrect* to use `Packet::new_checked()`;
//! the length check is likely to succeed on a zeroed buffer, but fail on a buffer
//! filled with data from a previous packet, such as when reusing buffers, resulting
//! in nondeterministic panics with some network devices but not others.
//! The buffer length for emission is not calculated by the `Packet` layer.
//!
//! In the `Repr` family of data structures, the `Repr::parse()` method never panics
//! as long as `Packet::new_checked()` (or `Packet::check_len()`) has succeeded, and
//! the `Repr::emit()` method never panics as long as the underlying buffer is exactly
//! `Repr::buffer_len()` octets long.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! To emit an IP packet header into an octet buffer, and then parse it back:
//!
