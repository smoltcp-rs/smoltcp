//! Access to networking hardware.
//!
//! The `phy` module deals with the *network devices*. It provides a trait
//! for transmitting and receiving frames, [Device](trait.Device.html),
//! as well as an implementations of that trait that uses the host OS,
//! [RawSocket](struct.RawSocket.html) and [TapInterface](struct.TapInterface.html).
//!
//! It also provides the _middleware interfaces_ [Tracer](struct.Tracer.html) and
//! [FaultInjector](struct.FaultInjector.html), to facilitate debugging.

//! An implementation of the [Device](trait.Device.html) trait for a simple hardware
//! Ethernet controller could look as follows:
