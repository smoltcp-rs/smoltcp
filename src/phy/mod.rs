/*! Access to networking hardware.

The `phy` module deals with the *network devices*. It provides a trait
for transmitting and receiving frames, [Device](trait.Device.html)
and implementations of it:

  * the [_loopback_](struct.Loopback.html), for zero dependency testing;
  * _middleware_ [Tracer](struct.Tracer.html) and
    [FaultInjector](struct.FaultInjector.html), to facilitate debugging;
  * _adapters_ [RawSocket](struct.RawSocket.html) and
    [TunTapInterface](struct.TunTapInterface.html), to transmit and receive frames
    on the host OS.

An implementation of the [Device](trait.Device.html) trait for a simple hardware
Ethernet controller could look as follows:

```rust

    rx_buffer: [u8; 1536],

            tx_buffer: [0; 1536],
        }
    }
}

impl<'a> phy::Device<'a> for StmPhy {
    type RxToken = StmPhyRxToken<'a>;
    type TxToken = StmPhyTxToken<'a>;

    fn receive(&'a mut self) -> Option<(Self::RxToken, Self::TxToken)> {
        Some((StmPhyRxToken(&mut self.rx_buffer[..]),

        let mut caps = DeviceCapabilities::default();
        caps.max_transmission_unit = 1536;
        caps.max_burst_size = Some(1);
        caps.medium = Medium::Ethernet;
        caps
    }
}
