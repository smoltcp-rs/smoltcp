# Enable Cubic TCP congestion control algorithm, and it is used as a default congestion controller.
#
# Cubic relies on double precision (`f64`) floating point operations, which may cause issues in some contexts:
#
# * Small embedded processors (such as Cortex-M0, Cortex-M1, and Cortex-M3) do not have an FPU,
#   and floating point operations consume significant amounts of CPU time and Flash space.
# * Interrupt handlers should almost always avoid floating-point operations.
# * Kernel-mode code on desktop processors usually avoids FPU operations to reduce the penalty of saving and restoring FPU registers.
#
# In all these cases, `CongestionControl::Reno` is a better choice of congestion control algorithm.
