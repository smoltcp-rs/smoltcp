# When bumping the toolchain version, note that it must be done in two pull
# requests - the first one being the version bump itself and the second one the
# necessary code changes based on the updated clippy lints (if any). This is due
# to the fact that actions-rs/clippy-check requires a GitHub API token with
# write permission on the "check" scope. A token of this type is only available
# when triggering on `pull_request_target`, but this runs the action using the
# configuration from the base of the pull request rather than the merge commit.
